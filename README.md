 How an ML system works?
What is machine learning? Simply, machine learning is humans try to mimic human brain by computer programs…Make computers think like humans.
We are gonna develop a system that can think like humans.

When it comes to building a machine learning system, we can build it in two ways.
1.We can code it by ourselves 
2.We can use other’s code to build a ML system.
