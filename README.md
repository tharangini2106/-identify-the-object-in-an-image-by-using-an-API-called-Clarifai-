 How an ML system works?
What is machine learning? Simply, machine learning is humans try to mimic human brain by computer programs…Make computers think like humans.That’s what we are gonna do this week..
We are gonna develop a system that can think like humans.

When it comes to building a machine learning system, we can build it in two ways.
1.We can code it by ourselves (We will learn how to code it by ourself in future classes)
2.We can use other’s code to build a ML system.
